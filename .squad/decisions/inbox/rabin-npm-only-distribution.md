# Decision: npm-only distribution (GitHub-native removed)

**By:** Rabin (Distribution)
**Date:** 2026-03-01
**Requested by:** Brady

## What Changed

All distribution now goes through npm. The `npx github:bradygaster/squad` path has been fully removed from:
- Source code (github-dist.ts default template, install-migration.ts, init.ts)
- All 4 copies of squad.agent.md (Ralph Watch Mode commands)
- All 4 copies of squad-insider-release.yml (release notes)
- README.md, migration guides, blog posts, cookbook, installation docs
- Test assertions (bundle.test.ts)
- Rabin's own charter (flipped from "never npmjs.com" to "always npmjs.com")

## Install Paths (the only paths)

```bash
# Global install
npm install -g @bradygaster/squad-cli

# Per-use (no install)
npx @bradygaster/squad-cli

# SDK for programmatic use
npm install @bradygaster/squad-sdk
```

## Why

One distribution channel means less confusion, fewer edge cases, and zero SSH-agent hang bugs. npm caching makes installs faster. Semantic versioning works properly. The root `cli.js` still exists with a deprecation notice for anyone who somehow hits the old path.

## Impact

- **All team members:** When writing docs or examples, use `npm install -g @bradygaster/squad-cli` or `npx @bradygaster/squad-cli`. Never reference `npx github:`.
- **CI/CD:** Insider release workflow now shows npm install commands in release notes.
- **Tests:** bundle.test.ts assertions updated to match new default template.
